# Price Increases In Upper West Side Restaurants Over The Last Five Years


Like Everything Else, Have Prices In Restaurants on the Upper West Side Gone Up in the Last Five Years? How Much Have Prices Risen?

With nearly everyone feeling the effects of inflation, I wanted to investigate how much prices in Upper West Side restaurants have risen in the last five years. Have price increases outpaced inflation? 

I found that like nearly everything else, prices in Upper West Side restaurants have increased precipitously. After examining the prices of eight restaurants over the last five years, I determined that price increases in four restaurants outpaced inflation and price increases in four restaurants trailed inflation. 

To get data, I went to the current web sites of eight Upper West Side restaurants that have been in business for at least five years. I collected data on the price of one appetizer, one signature main dish and one dessert. 

To get data on prices from 2019, I utilized the Internet Archive to find the prices on menus of the same main dish, appetizer and dessert. 
After I collected the data, I created my own database and started examining the data in Pandas. 


In Pandas, I calculated how much the price of main dishes at these eight restaurants had risen in five years. I compared the prices at the restaurants with each other and with the US inflation rate, using the latest CPI data. CPI data said that prices had risen 22% from 2019 to 2024. 


These were all new processes for me. I had never created my own dataset, organized data in Pandas or created graphics in Datawrapper. I learned a lot in the process, but want to become much more adept in Pandas specifically. 


If I had had more time for the project, I would have done some higher level calculations in Pandas with the data I collected. I also would like to explore other visualization tools because I found the options in Datawrapper to be quite limited.
